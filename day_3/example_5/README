This example shows the use of classes

A
--
Simple direct implementation of molecules as a list of atoms

B
--
showing the flexibility of objects to implement new method keeping the code clean a readable
shows limitation of molecule as list

C
--
Implementation of proper molecule class

*To show
---------
Adding new functionality for:
- center of mass
- principal moments of inertia
- nuclear energy
- separation in files/ organization of code
